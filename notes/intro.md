# General Plan

There are several methods for solving Rubik's cubes.

Right now, I have zero experience...

As I advance through this project, I will update the solve logic to make it more efficient and realistic.

* Implement most basic (and inefficient) Rubik's cube solver algorithms
* Deconstruct image into 3x3 grids composed of the 6 available colors
* Visualize solved result prior to calling the solve function
* Add some type of front-end allowing for UI
* Down the line, create digital version of solvable cubes with instructions
